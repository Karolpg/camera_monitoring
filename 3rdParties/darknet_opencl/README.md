This is taken from:
    https://github.com/ganyc717/Darknet-On-OpenCL.git

I provide it as builded version (binaries).
I have to make some changes to the original as it doesn't work with my GPU. I have some problems with memory alignment and resource management.
You can download sources from https://github.com/ganyc717/Darknet-On-OpenCL.git and build it on your own and replace binaries.
Maybe in future I will do it by git submodules.
